# Assignment 1 - Digit Recognition

This project is part of the Machine Learning Course.  
It is a simple digit recognition model that predicts handwritten digits using a trained neural network.

 **Tools Used:** Python, PyTorch, Google Colab
 **Dataset:** MNIST (handwritten digit dataset)
 **Accuracy:** Tested on sample digits with correct predictions

#How to Run
1. Open the provided `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
2. Run all cells.
3. The model will predict a digit from the dataset and display the actual value.

#Output Example
Predicted Digit: 7
Actual Digit: 7


# Assignment 3 - House Price Prediction

This project is part of the **Machine Learning Course**.
The goal is to predict the price of a house using machine learning techniques.

#What this project does:

* Loads a housing dataset
* Cleans and prepares the data
* Explores the data with graphs
* Splits the dataset into training and testing sets
* Implements **Gradient Descent** to train a regression model
* Tests the model and checks how well it predicts house prices

#Tools and Libraries used:

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* `pandas` → for handling data
* `numpy` → for calculations
* `matplotlib` → for graphs

#How to run:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Run the cells step by step.
3. Upload the dataset file (`Housing.csv`) when asked.

#Results:

* The model was able to make predictions, but the **R² value (accuracy) was low**.
* This happened because:
  * Not all factors that affect house price are included
  * Gradient Descent with a simple regression model cannot capture complex patterns
